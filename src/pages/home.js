      Glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, can severely decrease quality of life
and is very difficult to treat. Current research methods are heavily reliant on multi-omics and bioinformatics, which are compute and time-intensive. We will develop a computational platform to provide insights that can help in the treatment quality of glioblastoma cancer patients and advance glioblastoma cancer research.We will optimize the bioinformatic processes , model the evolution of cancer-causing cells, and produce a digital twin.
